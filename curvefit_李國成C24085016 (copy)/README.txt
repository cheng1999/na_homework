Degree of polynomial ==> 1
Coefficients are:
 [-6.1762277   9.43049604]
6
Std. deviation = 2.2354072585176956

Degree of polynomial ==> 2
Coefficients are:
 [ 4.37412424 -1.03210264  2.09912172]
5
Std. deviation = 0.8141426713443742



::: Observation :::
From the results' 'std. deviation', we can see that quadratic fit better than straight line to the data.
